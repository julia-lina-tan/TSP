# TSP

This project aims to implement the technique of Bayesian Hilbert Mapping (BHM) to build occupancy maps of dynamic unstructured environments (with uncertainty). The methods of Optimal Transport (OT) will then be used to develop a fusion framework for use with multi-robot mapping.

Requires:

1) Generate datasets from the lidar simulator
2) Run BHM and learn distributions of weights
3) OT fusion offline
4) OT fusion online/sequential
